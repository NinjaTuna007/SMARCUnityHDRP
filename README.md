# SMARC Unity

This project has all of the dependencies configured and installed in order to run assets from [SMARC Assets package](https://github.com/smarc-project/SMARCAssets) with minimal effort.

It uses HDRP, so you are going to need at least a dedicated GPU on your machine to run this smoothly.

See the README of [SMARC Assets package](https://github.com/smarc-project/SMARCAssets) for setup, citation and documentation.
